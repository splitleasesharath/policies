## 🏃 Getting Started (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Add Your PDFs (2 minutes)

Place your policy PDF files in the `pdfs/` folder:

```
pdfs/
├── background-check-consent.pdf
├── cancellation-refund-policy.pdf
├── community-guidelines.pdf
├── cookie-policy.pdf
├── fees-overview.pdf
├── host-guarantee.pdf
├── host-guarantee-terms.pdf
├── payments-terms.pdf
├── privacy-policy.pdf
└── terms-of-use.pdf
```

**Don't have PDFs yet?** The page will still work - add them later.

---

### Step 2: Test Locally (1 minute)

**Option A: Simple (just double-click)**
```
Double-click: index.html
```

**Option B: Local server (better)**
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Then visit: http://localhost:8000
```

---

### Step 3: Customize & Deploy (5 minutes)

1. **Update logo** in `index.html` (line ~20)
2. **Update colors** in `css/variables.css`
3. **Deploy** using one of these:
   - Netlify Drop (drag & drop)
   - GitHub Pages (push to repo)
   - Vercel (CLI deploy)
   - Traditional hosting (FTP upload)

See [`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for details.
